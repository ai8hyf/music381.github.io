									<p>When we talk about music, some people may start to imagine a scene of a pianist playing many notes with both hands. Others may think about an orchestra with dozens of players playing different notes and the final output sounds like one. Music for most people is polyphonic, complex, and colorful. However, 1000 years ago, most ancient musicians/composers were still working on music with one single melody line. Only a few of them started to try something new which was polyphonic music, and even fewer composers wrote down the pieces with their names and the precious documents were preserved till today.
									</p>
									<p> The story happened in a church in Paris. This church was later became well known because of Victor Hugo’s book “Notre Dame De Paris”. However, people may not know that Notre Dame is the place where the earliest known polyphonic music was born. Two names were preserved luckily and they were the earliest known polyphonic composers: Leoninus and Perotin.</p>

									<p>Leoninus was Perotin’s teacher. Perotin learned from Leoninus and developed polyphonic music even beyond his teacher’s achievement. Perotin refined many Leoninus’s work and making the 2-part music be 3 or 4-part. Here we have one example of Perotin’s polyphonic composition: Viderunt Omnes.
									</p>
									<p>This piece was composed in 1198. It had very simple lyric but very long duration. The approaches that Perotin conducted were very similar to some later techniques like “counterpoint”. We analyzed this piece from several perspectives.</p>

									<p>We have already talked about the earliest known polyphonic composers, but there were even earlier composers who discovered polyphonic music. Their names were known as “anonymous”.</p>
									<p>The earliest ones in record can be ascended to the 7th centuries. We do not have any first hand document about the music itself, but we can unveil the ancient treasure by other people’s description. The early polyphonic music did have enough rules or standards. One thing we knew that all of them had more than one voice.</p>

									<p>To deeply learn the history of polyphonic music, we did a lot of research including a discussion of Perotin’s date, a music Journal about Leoninus as both poet and musician, a collection of documents about early polyphony, and some analysis of different kind of early polyphonic schools.</p>
